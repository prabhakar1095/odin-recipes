# odin-recipes
This project is part of The Odins Project curriculum.
It will teach me following things:
1. Making ordered and unordered lists and its uses in real websites.
2. Proper way of using various elements along with their attributes in different cases.
3. How to add links according to requirements or conditions. 
4. Working with git and git hub to manage projects.

After completing this project, I will have improved my understanding and learned to use various kinds of elements in different contexts efficiently in real-world scenarios.
